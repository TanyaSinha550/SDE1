Set Matrix Zero 

App1 

if the range of elements in the matrix is in the positive side of zero .
Then use -1 as indicator.

Time Complexity - O( 2(m*n)+ (m+n) )
Space Complexity - O(1)

App2 

Use hashset 

Time Complexity - O( 2(m*n) )
Space Complexity - O(m+n)

App3

Time Complexity - O( 2(m*n) )
Space Complexity - O(1)
