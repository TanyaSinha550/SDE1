Approach for - Duplicates in an array when elements are not limited to a range

Note: The duplicate elements can be printed in any order.

Approach 1
Use nested loop and for each element check if the element is present in the array more than once or not.
If present store in ArrayList and check before adding.

Time Complexity -O(N2)
Auxiliary Space - O(N)

Approach 2
Use unordered_map for hashing. 
Count frequency of occurrence of each element and the elements with frequency more than 1 is printed. 
unordered_map is used as range of integers is not known

Auxiliary Space - O(N)
