Sort an array of 0's , 1's and 2's


Approach 1
Sort the array using merge sort

Time complexity - O(N log N)
Space complexity - O(N) 

Approach 2
Linearly tranverse the array and Count the 0 , 1 and 2.
Put them in array

Pros - 
Requires 2 passes
Time complexity -O(2N)


Approach 3
Dutch National Flag algorithm
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(1)
